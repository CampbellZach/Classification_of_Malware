This is a Machine Learning project that is able to predict whether a file is a malware or not. The dataset was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/classification-of-malwares) and the models work for both Raw and Integrated dataset. You should not have to run anything or download it to see the results. Credits and more details are stored within the jupyter notebook. This is a work in progress and will have additions added to it in the future.
